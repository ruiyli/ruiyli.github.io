I am currently a Master's student at the [Key Laboratory of Network and System Security (NSS Lab)](https://nss.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Associate Professor [Guangxia Li](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/LGX4/zh_CN/index/386575/list/index.htm). I have had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished researchers, including [Principal Researcher Peilin Zhao (Tencent AI Lab)](https://peilinzhao.github.io/), [Assistant Professor Zhiqiang Xu (MBZUAI)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0R20iBMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr. Xiao Lu (Ericsson)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6J6Xy8IAAAAJ).

My research interests lie in (generative) search/recommendation systems, (multimodal) large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models, which I am actively exploring. During my graduate studies, I have also conducted research on ADMM-based optimization for multi-task learning and addressing graph data heterogeneity in federated learning.

<span style="color:red"> I will be joining Tencent PCG to work on developing the ranking system for QQ App's search engine. Meanwhile, I remain open to PhD opportunities to further pursue my research interests. </span>
